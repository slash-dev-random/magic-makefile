This repository contains a generic makefile for C/C++ projects in a Linux 
environment.  It does automatic dependency generation and linking.  The
Project Makefile is designed to build all items under the source tree.  The
Workspace Makefile is designed to reside in a folder containing multiple
projects.  The Workspace Makefile assumes all the Projects in its directory
use the Project Makefile and are structured accordingly.  It does NOT do a
recursive make but instead reads the build definitions in each Project's
make/ directory and builds them accordingly.  More information about setting
up a Project using this makefile can be found in the Project README.txt
